                    <li><span>3D Modeler & Sculpter</span><br>I am constantly working on improving my 3D models to achieve my goals and objectives. With each iteration, I strive to create more realistic and visually stunning designs that meet the needs of my clients and exceed their expectations.</li>
                    <li><span>2D texture Painter & Casual 2D artist</span><br>I am a 2D texture painter and casual 2D artist. 
                        I specialize in creating textures for 3D models and have a passion for drawing characters in a relaxed and informal style. 
                        My goal is to work with companies that share my values and ethical standards, using my skills to create art that truly stands out.</li>
                    <li><span>Front end Developer</span><br>I am currently working on developing front-end code and giving it my primary focus. Additionally, I am also working on some back-end code to complement the overall development process.</li>

                    <li><span>2021 - First solo desktop PC Assembly</span><br>
                        <p>
                            My first experience building my first desktop PC was terrible, I had to fix 2 of the processor pins that I warped by myself. After losing my warranty and crying a lot ðŸ˜­, I realized that I can't just lament and let like this, so I started to fix the pins for my PC and It just started working after all that suffering, and as magic, my pc it's good to go and it is working very well after 2 years of use!
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li><span>2022 - Started a 3 year programming course</span><br>
                        <p>
                            So, after desiring to know more about tech, and in my future, working in that sector, I realized what I knew about software and its development was zero to half one percent, there is where came the course from. With zero knowledge required, I just started to learn about the technologies that we use every single day, to build my own software, website, user interface, or what else the world gives me to do (at least my thought on that year) by the market needs. I knew that will be a hard journey, and a has able to pay every single price for the tuff process because it is my future was depending on my success, and no one else can have my success for me.

                        <p>
                            The first-course year was completed with success, and now It is time to develop my skills as a front-end programmer, so this portfolio isnâ€™t the first that I'm trying to finish, but will be completed and constantly updated by myself. The time was summer vacation, and the certifications, the extracurricular courses, this portfolio, and my CV (Curriculum Vitae), all of them will be in progress and will be surely done, I await you, Web Summit.
