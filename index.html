               Greetings! 
               My name is Abhay Silveira Mendes and I am an aspiring programmer passionate about creating artwork in 3D and 2D, focusing on 3D artwork. 
               As I improve myself to enhance my artistic skills, I am also committed to learning how to code to enhance my workflow and become more self-sufficient in my career. 
               I am excited to apply my technical and creative talents to a programming role and contribute to a dynamic team if needed.</p>
